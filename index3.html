                    <p>Hi everybody! My name is Michal Vesely and I am writing this letter to express my
                        interest in the
                        front-end development. <br>
                        I have recently returned from Australia, where I was studying English Language, Business and
                        Management,

                        Diploma of Business, Advanced Diploma of Business, and improving my coding skills by myself.
                        <br>
                        I also completed online course of programming languages where I received the certificate from
                        HTML|CSS
                        & JavaScript. Additionally, I have ECDL license. <br>
                        I am a highly motivated individual who is always looking to improve my skills. <br> I am a quick
                        learner
                        and
                        have no problem picking up new technologies.
                        I am based in the Czech Republic and I would ideally like to work remotely.
