                    <li>Hi everybody! Let me express my
                        interest in the front-end development.</li>
                    <li>I have recently returned from Australia, where I was studying English Language, <br>
                        Business and
                        Management and found out that web development is something <br> I really like to do in my free
                        time
                        so I was improving my skills by myself.
                    </li>
                    <li>Coding is something that makes me happy and enjoyment so I keep continue to developing my skills
                        everyday.</li>
                    <li>A few months ago I completed online course of HTML|CSS & JavaScript to get a better
                        understanding.</li>
                    <li>I am a highly motivated to learn and increase my knowledge of programming languages.</li>
                    <li>To conclude, I do enjoy working with computers and technology because I learn something new
                        everyday and that is inspiring.</li>
